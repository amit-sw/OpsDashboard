# OpsDashboard

Initial project scaffold for the OpsDashboard application. The repository currently provides:

- `app.py` as the runnable entry point.
- `src/` for core application modules (to be implemented).
- `test/` for automated tests.
- `doc/` for user-facing documentation.

Update this document as features and dependencies are added.
